# Scrub

Simple macOS cleaner tool.

## Motivation

When you delete an application from your mac, it leaves a number of files on
the system, which takes space for no reason. Although there are existing tools
that can delete these files, I have not yet seen a command-line macOS cleaner
tool (I'm not gonna lie, I didn't search for it). My laziness to search for
existing tools combined with OCD and NIH syndrome, gave me enough motivation
to write scrub.

## Installation

If you are interested in using scrub, you have to build from source:
```
make release
```

## Contributions

I welcome all different forms of contributions to this project, including
simply using it. If you are interested in contributing to the development of
scrub, you can report issues or feature requests, or create pull requests.
